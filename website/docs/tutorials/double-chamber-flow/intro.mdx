## SpaRTaNS Tutorial: Double Chamber Flow

#### Last updated: 04/30/2022

Below, we walk through a non-trivial example to demonstrate a typical SpaRTaNS use-case.  
The example is based on [Direct observation of vortices in an electron fluid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02798) and highlights the following features:

- Complicated geometry
- Diffuse boundary conditions along chambers
- Periodic boundary conditions along channel

We find the Wolfram Language's finite element implementation to be a very flexible way of obtaining complicated mesh geometries, and thus use it for the following examples.  
The same properties can of-course be obtained using any other meshing software.

The notebooks have been split-up into thematic notebooks for ease of demonstration. The complete examples can be found in the [source repository](https://github.com/narang-lab/spartans/tree/main/tutorials/double-chamber-flow/notebooks).
