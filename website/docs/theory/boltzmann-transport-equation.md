# Boltzmann Transport Equation

:::caution

The Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) is given by
$$
\partial_t n_i + \boldsymbol{v}_i\cdot\nabla_{\boldsymbol{r}} + \boldsymbol{F}\cdot\nabla_{\boldsymbol{k}} n_i + \Gamma_i = 0
$$
where $n_i(\boldsymbol{r})$ is the distribution function of carriers in combined state index $i$ (encompassing the wavevector $\boldsymbol{k}$ and band $\nu$), $\boldsymbol{v}_i$ is the group velocity of state $i$, $\boldsymbol{F}$ is an external driving force, and $\Gamma_i[\{n_j(\boldsymbol{r})\}]$ is the collision operator, whichspecifiestherateat which carriers scatter into and out of state $i$ as a function of the full carrier distribution $n_j$ at position $\boldsymbol{r}$.
